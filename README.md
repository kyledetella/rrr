Reduce. Reuse. React.
=====================

This is my WIP example (and exploration) of a web application architecture using Flux + React.

## Install

```
nvm use && npm i
```

## Run

```
npm run development
```

This will start up gulp watch tasks as well as the node server.


To run the server in isolation:

```
DEBUG=rrr ./bin/www
```
